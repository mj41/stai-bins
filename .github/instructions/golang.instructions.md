Use golang best practices. For advanced topics do research online first.

Required templates, help, readme and other files should be included using `//go:embed` directive.

Build every tool to `bin/` directory. Do not use `go install` command. Use `go build -o bin/toolname` instead. For temporary work you can build to `temp/bin/` directory.

## Generators and generated files

Check `go:build generate` to understand which files require `go generate` command.

Generators should use `runtime.Caller(0)` to get the path of the source files and the files they are generating.

Never ever edit generated files. Such files have `// Code generated by ... DO NOT EDIT.` (or similar) comment at the top.

## Shared code

Use `mjai-pkgs` for shared code across tools. Make sure you are not re-inventing the wheel.
