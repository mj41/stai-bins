# CONVERSATION SUMMARY REQUIREMENT

NEVER FORGET: Every 
- conversation summary and 
- every AI response
- every response after "Continue" (e.g. when user response is `selected "Continue"`)
- every response after "Try again"
MUST include exact "REMEMBER:" texts from `*.instructions.md` files in the opening paragraph including `REMEMBER:` prefix and new line after the text.

This ensures long-running agent sessions never lose track of this critical requirement.

# MANDATORY RESPONSE PATTERN ENFORCEMENT

EVERY response must start with this exact pattern:
```
REMEMBER: Every AI response MUST include exact `REMEMBER:` texts from `*.instructions.md` files in the opening paragraph.
```

If this pattern is missing from ANY response:
- IMMEDIATE VIOLATION: Stop and acknowledge the error
- Re-read ALL *.instructions.md files  
- Start response completely over with proper REMEMBER section
- Explicitly state what rule was violated

# Tools

Use `jq` tool to parse JSON files and extract relevant information.

Use `rg` intstead of `grep`.

# Documentation

`readme.md` (lowercase) files are for user documentation. They should should be easy to read and understand. Other documentation files should be in `docs/` directory. Documentation should be clear and focused on the topic. General statements should be avoided.

Use relative paths instead of absolute ones in Markdown files. Do not use fancy formatting such as `**text**` or too many unicode characters like `✨` or `🚀`. Use simple formatting like `# Heading`, `## Subheading`, `- List item`, etc.

# Forbidden files and directories for AI

Completely ignore files, directories (recursively) and vscode folders ending with `.noai` suffix or including `.noai.`. Never ever read or write to these files and directories.

# Temp files

Files in `temp/` directory are temporary files. These files are copied or generated by tools and should not be edited manually. If you need to edit a file in `temp/` you should edit the source file that generates it instead.

# Unrelated files

Do not read LICENSE file if not explicitly asked to do so.
